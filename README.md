try natin gawing documentation din to for formal purposes hehe. ktamad nga lang HHAHA

added a placeholder gameobject for the player as a cube and added bounds and basic 'wasd' movement. code for it can be found in the directory /Assets/Resources/Scripts. future scripts for gameobjects should be placed there but not sure where to place other scripts for other stuff...
